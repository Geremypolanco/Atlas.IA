‚úÖ AI Function Cloning Complete!

üìä Statistics:
- Total responses cloned: {len(all_responses)}
- ChatGPT functions: {len([r for r in all_responses if r['ai_source'] == 'chatgpt_clone'])}
- Claude functions: {len([r for r in all_responses if r['ai_source'] == 'claude_clone'])}
- Gemini functions: {len([r for r in all_responses if r['ai_source'] == 'gemini_clone'])}
- Perplexity functions: {len([r for r in all_responses if r['ai_source'] == 'perplexity_clone_free'])}

üéØ Next Steps:
1. Run preprocess.py to prepare data for training
2. Execute train.py to fine-tune AtlasCore
3. Deploy with app.py for autonomous operation
