# AtlasCore - AI Function Cloning and Training System

## Overview
AtlasCore is an autonomous AI system that clones capabilities from leading AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) and trains a unified model with their combined intelligence.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Execute complete training pipeline
python execute_atlas_training.py

# Or run individual components:
python clone_functions.py    # Clone AI capabilities
python preprocess.py         # Process training data
python train.py             # Train AtlasCore model
python atlas_app.py         # Deploy trained system
```

## System Architecture

### Phase 1: AI Function Cloning
- `clone_functions.py`: Extracts capabilities from multiple AI sources
- Uses free APIs and web scraping for data collection
- Generates `atlas_dataset.jsonl` with labeled AI responses

### Phase 2: Data Preprocessing  
- `preprocess.py`: Cleans and enhances training data
- Removes duplicates and calculates quality scores
- Creates `atlas_processed_dataset.jsonl` for training

### Phase 3: Model Training
- `train.py`: Fine-tunes base model with LoRA
- Uses HuggingFace transformers for efficient training
- Outputs trained model in `atlas_model_[timestamp]/`

### Phase 4: Deployment
- `atlas_app.py`: FastAPI application for autonomous operation
- Provides REST API endpoints for chat, analysis, and research
- Supports both trained model and fallback responses

3. **GitHub API**: Development trends and repositories
4. **Public APIs**: Various data sources for training
5. **Web Scraping**: Additional content gathering

### Training Dataset Structure
```json
{
  "input": "User prompt",
  "output": "AI response", 
  "ai_source": "chatgpt_clone|claude_clone|gemini_clone|perplexity_clone_free",
  "function_type": "conversational|analytical|creative|research",
  "quality_score": 85,
  "capabilities": ["reasoning", "analysis", "problem_solving"]
}
```

## Performance Metrics
